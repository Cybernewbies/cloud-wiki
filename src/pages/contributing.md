# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this knowledge base! We welcome all input from the community.  If you'd like to contribute but aren't sure where to start, pick an open issue from the GitHub repository on a topic you know something about and begin work there.

The contribution process is as follows:

* Fork the repository
* Make your changes to the appropriate files under `/docs`
* Open a merge request, and fill in the merge template

Drop Nick Jones, Christian Philipov or Mohit Gupta a line on the Cloud Security Forum Slack workspace, or Twitter, if you have questions or need some support.
